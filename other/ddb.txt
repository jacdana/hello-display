Hello, ddb! My name is Jac. I need some help.
I am making a simple full-screen display using the TKinter library. 
I successfully coded a desired background image and overlaying text using 
a canvas (ttk.Canvas()). 

I now want to put a dynamic clock on top of that background. Since the clock 
is text that changes with time, I don't believe a canvas can handle that. 
(With canvas's .create_text(), there is a "text=" option but not a "textvariable" 
option like there is for a ttk.Label(). )

However, when I try to make the clock as a ttk.Label(parent=canvas) 
with the display changing using the textvariable= option, the clock works 
but seemingly deletes or covers the background made by the canvas.

What is happening? And how can I have both a pretty background and a clock?

Please let me know if there is any further info I can provide so you can better answer my question.


ddb
Hello Jac! It seems like you're trying to overlay a dynamic clock on top of a background image using TKinter.

The issue you're facing might be due to the fact that the ttk.Label widget is not designed to be a child of a Canvas widget. When you set parent=canvas for your ttk.Label, it might be causing unexpected behavior.

Instead, you could try creating the ttk.Label as a child of the same parent as the Canvas, and then use the place method to position the Label on top of the Canvas. This way, both the Canvas and the Label would be independent children of the same parent, and they wouldn't interfere with each other.

Remember, you'll need to update the clock text periodically. You can use the after method to schedule a function that updates the clock text every second or so.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

So now the clock works, but the digits of the display are on the solid-colored rectangular background of the Label(). Is there anyway to have the background of the Label be transparent, or equivalent?


ddb
Yes, you can make the background of the Label widget transparent by setting its background option to the same color as the parent widget or the color of your canvas. However, please note that full transparency is not supported in Tkinter.

Here's an example of how you can set the background color:

clock_label = ttk.Label(parent, textvariable=time_string, background='your_background_color')
Replace 'your_background_color' with the color of your canvas or the parent widget. This will give the illusion of a transparent background for your clock label.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.


you
Unfortunately that won't work for me as the background I'm using is not a solid color. Is there any other way to make dynamic text using TKinter?


ddb
Yes, there are other ways to create dynamic text in Tkinter. One way is to use the Canvas widget's itemconfig method to update the text of a text item. Here's a general idea of how you can do it:

Create a text item on the Canvas using the create_text method.
Store the ID returned by create_text in a variable.
Use the itemconfig method with the stored ID to update the text.
This way, you can have dynamic text on a Canvas with a complex background. Remember to use the after method to schedule the text updates.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

if I want to check if the current time is between two given times, can i do that using the time module? if so, how


Yes, you can use the time module in Python to check if the current time is between two given times. Here's a general idea of how you can do it:

Use time.localtime() to get the current time as a time.struct_time object.
Access the tm_hour and tm_min attributes of the time.struct_time object to get the current hour and minute.
Compare the current hour and minute with the hours and minutes of the two given times.
Remember, you'll need to convert your given times to the 24-hour format if they're not already in that format. This is because tm_hour returns the hour in 24-hour format.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

How can I get the current hour as an integer (0 through 23) from the datetime library?


ddb
In Python, you can use the datetime library to get the current hour. First, you need to import the library. 
Then, you can use datetime.datetime.now().hour to get the current hour as an integer from 0 to 23. 
Remember to implement this in your code and let me know if you have any further questions.


you
why datetime.datetime.now().hour ? why is datetime appended twice?


ddb
In Python's datetime module, the first datetime is the name of the module, 
and the second datetime is a class within that module. The now() function is a method of the datetime class, 
which returns the current date and time. By appending .hour, you're accessing the hour attribute 
of the datetime object returned by now(). So datetime.datetime.now().hour is saying "from the datetime module, 
use the datetime class's now method, and give me the hour attribute."


you
does the datetime library have the strftime or equivalent? If so, how do I use it?


ddb
Yes, the datetime library in Python does have a method called strftime(). 
This method allows you to create a string representing the time under the control of an explicit format string.

Here's a basic example of how you can use it:

import datetime  
current_time = datetime.datetime.now()  
formatted_time = current_time.strftime("%H:%M:%S")  
In this example, "%H:%M:%S" is the format string. %H gets replaced by the hour (in 24-hour clock), %M by the minute, and %S by the second.

There are many other directives you can use in the format string to represent other components of the date and time. 
You can find more information in the Python documentation for strftime().
